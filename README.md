# GEM Polaris ECE 484 Team Kachow

Disclaimer: No one can actually run this locally unless you have access to a UIUC ubuntu machine in the ECE 484 classroom. This README file rather shows the results of our project. 

## Abstract

This is a project in which we test out a pipeline which we run using ROS on a GEM Polaris Vehicle. This pipeline includes step-by-step processing of ROS subscriber images generated by ZED2 Camera output to publishing steering angle. This also includes algorithms on how we publish acceleration values and how we maneuver through complex environments such as rainy and snowy conditions.

## Design
### ① Steering
Below shows an image of the pipeline we use to processing our ZED2 Camera output. Once processed, we calculate an approximate steering angle for which the car should turn.
